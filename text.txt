Once upon a time, in a sunny little village, there lived a curious girl named Tilly. She loved exploring the forest behind her house, even though everyone said it was “just a normal forest.”

One bright morning, Tilly tiptoed into the woods, her backpack full of snacks and a notebook. As she wandered deeper, she spotted a huge tree with a smiling face carved in its bark.

“Hello, Tilly!” said the tree in a gentle voice.

Tilly jumped back. “You… you can talk?”

“Of course!” said the tree. “I’ve been waiting for a friend to help me find my lost magic acorns.”

Excited, Tilly agreed to help. They searched under bushes, behind rocks, and even across a sparkling little stream. Along the way, Tilly met a squirrel wearing a tiny red scarf and a bluebird that could whistle tunes like a piano.

Finally, under a rainbow of fallen leaves, they found the last golden acorn. The tree’s branches swirled with shimmering light.

“Thank you, Tilly! Because of your kindness and courage, I can grant you a wish,” said the tree.

Tilly thought for a moment. “I wish… for the forest to always be full of happy friends and adventures!”

The tree nodded, and from that day on, Tilly visited the forest every week, discovering new friends and magical surprises. She learned that friendship and curiosity could make even the ordinary world
