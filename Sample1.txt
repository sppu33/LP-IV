The Red Fort is one of the most remarkable historical monuments in India. It is located in the heart of Delhi and was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1648. Constructed using red sandstone, the fort stands as a symbol of India's rich heritage and architectural brilliance. The massive walls of the Red Fort stretch over two kilometers and are surrounded by lush green gardens. Every year, the Prime Minister of India hoists the national flag here on Independence Day. This magnificent fort remains a reminder of the glorious past and the artistic excellence of the Mughal era.
